This reduces latency because data doesn't need to travel far, enabling faster responses in real-time. It also enhances privacy since sensitive data stays on the device.\n\nExample:\nIn autonomous drones, Edge AI allows real-time object detection and navigation without needing to connect to the internet.\n\n Q2: Quantum AI vs Classical AI\nAnswer:\nClassical AI uses traditional computing to solve problems step-by-step. Quantum AI uses quantum bits that can represent multiple states, enabling parallel computations. For optimization tasks like logistics or drug discovery, Quantum AI can explore more possibilities faster.\n\nIndustries benefiting:\n\nPharmaceutical (drug discovery)\n\nLogistics (route optimization)\n\nFinance (risk modeling)\n\n Q3: Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare\nAnswer:\nAI supports healthcare professionals by analyzing medical images, predicting patient outcomes, and suggesting treatments. Radiologists may rely on AI to detect anomalies faster, while nurses can use AI tools to monitor patient vitals and trigger alerts.\n\nSocietal impact:\n\nImproved diagnosis accuracy\n\nReduced workload\n\nNeed for upskilling professionals\n\n Case Study: AI in Smart Cities – Traffic Management\nAnalysis:\nIntegrating AI with IoT improves urban sustainability by analyzing real-time traffic data to reduce congestion, emissions, and fuel use.\n\nTwo challenges:\n\nData Security – Real-time vehicle tracking raises privacy concerns.\n\nInfrastructure Cost – Installing smart sensors and maintaining networks is expensive.\n\n Part 2: Practical Implementation \n⚙️ Task 1: Edge AI Prototype (Image Classifier)\nTools: TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), Colab/Raspberry Pi","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"791156a6-a2b4-4bd1-bcb0-2fe1db8114f2","cell_type":"code","source":"\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D\nfrom tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10\nimport numpy as np\n\n\n(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()\nx_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0\n\nmodel = Sequential([\n    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32,32,3)),\n    MaxPooling2D(2,2),\n    Flatten(),\n    Dense(64, activation='relu'),\n    Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n])\n\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\n              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n\nmodel.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))\n\n\nloss, acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)\nprint(\"Test Accuracy:\", acc)\n\n\nconverter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)\ntflite_model = converter.convert()\nwith open('recycler_model.tflite', 'wb') as f:\n    f.write(tflite_model)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"id":"1a14e0b1-0c92-4db5-b98a-9b3a94a6e153","cell_type":"markdown","source":"Task 2: AI-Driven IoT Agriculture Concept\nSmart Agriculture Proposal (Summary)\n\nSensors needed:\n\nSoil moisture sensor\n\nTemperature sensor\n\nHumidity sensor\n\nLight intensity sensor\n\nAI Model:\n\nRegression model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict crop yield from environmental data\n\nData Flow Diagram:\n\nplaintext\nCopy\nEdit\n[Sensors] → [Microcontroller] → [Data Storage] → [AI Model] → [Crop Prediction Dashboard]\n⚖️ Task 3: Ethics in Personalized Medicine\nAnalysis (300 Words):\n\nAI models in personalized medicine can exhibit bias if trained on non-diverse datasets. For example, cancer treatment recommendations may not generalize well for underrepresented ethnic groups, leading to ineffective or harmful outcomes.\n\nPotential Bias Sources:\n\nHistorical data lacking diversity\n\nGenomic datasets dominated by certain populations\n\nAlgorithmic assumptions not reflecting minority physiology\n\nFairness Strategies:\n\nEnsure training data includes various age, gender, and ethnic groups\n\nApply fairness-aware machine learning techniques (e.g., reweighting, adversarial debiasing)\n\nUse interpretable models to detect bias in decision logic\n\nConduct ongoing fairness audits post-deployment\n\n Part 3: Futuristic Proposal (2030 AI)\nTitle: AI-Powered Climate Control via Smart Forests\n\nProblem:\nClimate change leads to extreme heatwaves and droughts. There is a need for intelligent carbon capture and temperature regulation systems.\n\nAI Workflow:\n\nData Inputs: Satellite imagery, air quality sensors, soil data\n\nModel Type: Reinforcement learning for forest maintenance & irrigation\n\nOutput: Optimize CO₂ absorption, tree planting, and water use\n\nRisks:\n\nPrivacy from surveillance sensors\n\nDependence on AI systems\n\nResource
